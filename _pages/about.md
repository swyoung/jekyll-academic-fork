![profile image >](../assets/img/profile_circle_small.png)

I’m an associate professor and User Experience & Assessment Librarian at Montana State University.

I publish and present across the fields of library user experience, assessment, and technology. I’ve been invited to present my work on participatory design and library assessment to the University of Washington, the Orbis Cascade Alliance, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the Kentucky Library Association, and the California Libraries Learn (CALL) Academy. I’m a past co-convener of the DLF Privacy and Ethics in Technology Working Group, and I hosted a National Forum on Web Privacy and Web Analytics with support from the Institute of Museum and Library Studies. In 2019 I was named a Library Journal Mover & Shaker. I currently serve as editor-in-chief of Weave: Journal of Library User Experience, where I collaborate with a team of editors in shaping the professional and scholarly conversation around UX in libraries.

I hold an MA in Archives and Public History from New York University, an MS in Library and Information Science from Long Island University, and a PhD in Library and Information Science from Humboldt University of Berlin, with a dissertation that examines the ethical practice of library assessment.

The ultimate aim of my research and practice is to help make libraries work better for more people. Read more on my CV.
